# CIA's CAESAR, POLO, and ESAU Papers (Transcriptions)

This repository contains Markdown transcriptions and a browsable catalog of three CIA historical series from the Cold War era (1953–1973), which together were about 11,000 pages: **CAESAR**, **POLO**, and **ESAU**. These papers constitute remarkable in-depth analyses of decisionmaking in China, the Soviet Union, and the Sino-Soviet relationship during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. 

The original declassified papers are available from CIA's website as PDF documents. I transcribed them into text to make the collection easier to search, quote, reuse. I particularly wanted to create text-only transcriptions to facilitate analysis using large language models.

For background and context, see ["Cold War Era Hard Target Analysis Of Soviet And Chinese Policy And Decision Making, 1953-1973"]( <./Introduction - The Caesar Polo and Esau Papers.md> ), written by CIA historians in 2007. Dylan Levi King also [wrote an analysis](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/heretics-in-the-cia-predicting-the) of these materials in the January 24, 2024 edition of ChinaTalk, much of which is not paywalled.

## How to browse
Start with a series:
  - **[CAESAR](./caesar/README.md)**: Soviet leadership politics and decisionmaking.
  - **[POLO](./polo/README.md)**: Chinese leadership politics and decisionmaking.
  - **[ESAU](./esau/README.md)**: The Sino-Soviet relationship.

Inside each series you’ll find subfolders by **year** and a **Table of Contents** with links to transcripts and original PDFs.

## Catalog
The master catalog is **[`catalog/catalog.csv`](./catalog/catalog.csv)** with fields like `title`, `publication_date`, `producing_office`, `original_classification`, `page_count`, and the `source_url`.

## Provenance & caveats
- Transcriptions were produced via OCR; expect occasional mistakes. If you spot significant errors, feel free to open an issue or suggest a fix.
- Document metadata in each Markdown file comes from the catalog and/or source PDF metadata where available.
- Filenames/IDs follow the CIA series conventions, e.g. `esau-13`, `polo-34`, etc.
