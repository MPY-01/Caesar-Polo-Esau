GROUP 1 EXCLUDED FROM AUTOMATIC DOWNGRADING AND DECLASSIFICATION "Any kind of organization is all right, as long as it is in the name of the great cultural revolution. The organizing of different opinions is the freedom of organization."

--Zhou Enlai, speech to students at Tsinghua University, 22 August 1966 RED GUARD AND REVOLUTIONARY REBEL ORGANIZATIONS IN COMMUNIST CHINA (A RESEARCH AID)

Introduction

These working charts, prepared by the DDI/Special Research Staff (in progress) of the Red Guard and Revolutionary Rebel movement in Communist China. An attempt has been made to identify the major Red Guard and Revolutionary Rebel groups in each province, autonomous region, and major city, to list the opponents as well as the allies of these groups, to note shifts in these alliances over time and to provide a brief chronology of the varying fortunes of these organizations as of May 1968 (where possible).

Users of these charts should note the following two points. First, the description of a given Red Guard or Revolutionary Rebel group as "revolutionary," "conservative," "counterrevolutionary," and so forth, is in every case taken from official Chinese Communist statements (e.g., Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Madame Mao, the Central Committee, the Central CRG) and does not represent a judgment of the DDI/SRS. These statements are usually found in Red Guard pronouncements but are believed to be accurately rendered. On the other hand, Red Guard pronouncements per se as to the political leanings of their own or other groups have not been used, as they are notoriously biased and misleading.

Second, allied and opposing groups are identified only on the basis of concrete evidence. For example, in a given province, group "1" may be opposed by group "2", but the inference does not necessarily follow that groups "2" and "3" are allies (the three groups may, in fact, be mutually hostile).

The DDI/SRS would welcome comment on these working charts, addressed to either the Chief of the Staff or the compiler, Dennis Doolin, [REDACTED] List of Abbreviations aka also known as Assn Association CC Central Committee Coll(s) College(s) c-revy counterrevolutionary CRG Cultural Revolution Group Ctte Committee est established Gen General GHQ General Headquarters GPCR Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Hqs Headquarters Jt Joint L-M Lower-Middle M-S(s) Middle School(s) nfi not further identified prep preparatory prol proletarian revy revolutionary RG(s) Red Guard(s)

RGA Revolutionary Great Alliance TTOMTT "the thought of Mao Zedong" Univ(s) University(ies) YCL Young Communist League NOTE The number under the columns labeled "Opponents" and "Supporters" refers to the number assigned arbitrarily by the compiler to each Red Guard or Revolutionary Rebel group. For example, in Anhwei Province, "27 August" (group #4) is supported by #10 (Red Guard Army) and opposed by #11 (Army 11th Command). In Zhejiang Province, #1 is opposed by #3 and supported by groups 11 through 20. These numbers are not in-tended to indicate any hierarchy of importance or power among the various Red Guard groups in a given province. They are solely for purposes of identification in this publication. The user will also note the detailed listing of Red Guard groups for some areas (Beijing, Guangdong, etc.) and the brief compilations for others (Kirin, Ninghsia, Shensi). The brevity of the latter is due solely to lack of information. ANHWEI PROVINCE Red Guard/Revolutionary Rebel Groups 1. Hofei Colleges & M-Ss RG Revy Rebel Hqs. (est. 18 October 1966) 2.
